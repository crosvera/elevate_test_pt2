# Elevate DevOps test pt2

## The problem

Our code is organized such that some of the repositories are included as submodules in others. Since we update these dependencies regularly, itâ€™s important to keep them updated in the
repositories that use them.
Given a submodule named content, please implement a solution to create a GitHub pull request which updates the version of that submodule to the latest commit on its main branch. Your solution should run on a regular schedule and also automatically add a set of GitHub users
as reviewers on the pull request.

## Solution

In order to accomplish this we rely on [`dependabot`](https://github.com/dependabot), a tool from GitHub that facilitates the dependecy updates in our repositories. To start with it, we need to create a configuration file called `dependabot.yaml` at the `.github` subdirectory.

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "gitsubmodule"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "daily"
    reviewers:
      - "crosvera"
```

In this configuration file we can set the different dependencies update mechanisms, in this case we are using `gitsubmodule`. `dependabot` will check all submodules under the `directory`. You can set the frequency that `dependabot` can check for dependency updates using the [`schedule.interval` option](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file#scheduleinterval). `dependabot` will gather all the updates available for our dependencies and will push them as a PR, in order to add reviewers to that PR, we can set the `reviewers` option with the usernames of the GitHub accounts.
